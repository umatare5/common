## üìù Commit Guidelines

**MUST** follow these commit practices:

- **Meaningful Commits:** Split files into meaningful units when committing. Group related changes together and commit them as logical units rather than committing all changes at once.

- **Respect .gitignore:** Always respect `.gitignore` rules when committing. Do not include ignored files such as `.copilot_reports/`, temporary files, or build artifacts in commits.
