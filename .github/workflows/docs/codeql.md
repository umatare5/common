## üìù Prerequisites

- Repository with source code in supported languages
- For manual build languages (C/C++, Swift), provide custom build commands
- Appropriate permissions configured for security events

## üìñ Advanced Usage

### 1. Multiple Languages Analysis

```yaml
jobs:
  codeql:
    uses: umatare5/common/.github/workflows/codeql.yml@main
    with:
      languages: "actions,go,javascript-typescript,python"
      codeql_queries: "security-extended,security-and-quality"
```

### 2. Custom Build Commands for Manual Build

```yaml
jobs:
  codeql:
    uses: umatare5/common/.github/workflows/codeql.yml@main
    with:
      languages: "c-cpp"
      build_commands: |
        make clean
        make bootstrap
        make release
```

### 3. Extended Security Analysis

```yaml
jobs:
  codeql:
    uses: umatare5/common/.github/workflows/codeql.yml@main
    with:
      languages: "go,javascript-typescript"
      codeql_queries: "security-extended,security-and-quality"
      fetch_depth: 0 # Full history for better analysis
```

### 4. Performance Optimization

```yaml
jobs:
  codeql:
    uses: umatare5/common/.github/workflows/codeql.yml@main
    with:
      languages: "go"
      runs_on: "ubuntu-latest-4-cores" # Use larger runner for faster analysis
```

### 5. Scheduled Security Scans

```yaml
name: Weekly Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * 1" # Every Monday at 2 AM

jobs:
  codeql:
    uses: umatare5/common/.github/workflows/codeql.yml@main
    with:
      languages: "actions,go"
      codeql_queries: "security-extended,security-and-quality"
```

## üîß Query Packs

Available CodeQL query packs for enhanced security analysis:

- `security-extended`: Extended security queries beyond the default set
- `security-and-quality`: Comprehensive security and code quality queries
- Custom query packs: Specify your own query pack URLs

## üõ°Ô∏è Required Permissions

The calling workflow must include these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  security-events: write # Required for all workflows
  packages: read # Required to fetch internal or private CodeQL packs
  actions: read # Only required for workflows in private repositories
  contents: read # Only required for workflows in private repositories
```

## üìä Analysis Results

- Results are automatically uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Alerts are created for discovered vulnerabilities
- SARIF files are generated for detailed analysis
- Integration with GitHub Advanced Security features
